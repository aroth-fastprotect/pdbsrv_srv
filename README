pdbsrv_srv
==========

See the python docstring for more blurb.

SYNOPSIS:

	On-demand wrapper for MSPDBSRV.EXE. See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9104 

	You start the client inside your Jenkins job. If necessary, it starts the server.

	The server lives while > 0 clients want it to. The server (tries to) ensure that MSPDBSRV.EXE
	is running at all times. When the server dies (because the last client died) it 
	takes MSPDBSRV.EXE down with it.

INVOCATION:

	$ BUILD_ID=something # not needed in Jenkins job
	$ cd $location_of_pdbsrv_srv_dot_py  # see BUGS
	$ python pdbsrv_srv.py -l /path/to/logfile.log &

MONITORING:

	Once running, you can 

	$ telnet localhost 50005
	> status
	# status information
	> [RETURN]
	OK

BUGS:

	* BUILD_ID must be defined in the environment, which is a pain when you
	  want to run it manually.

	* you need to start it from directory the script is in, because it tries
	  to recursively execute itself and only looks in the current dir.

        * logging is a mess.

	* status command doesn't tell you enough information. (Specifically, it 
          doesn't help you much identifying the clients)

 	* Behavior is undefined (and likely broken) if MSPDBSRV.EXE is already
	  running when the server starts.
